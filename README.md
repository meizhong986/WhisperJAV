## Key Notes

WhisperJAV uses [faster-whisper](https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper) to achieve roughly 2x the speed of the original Whisper, along with additional post-processing to remove hallucinations and repetition.


- **Faster with WAV:** The script runs *much* faster using WAV audio format.  
- **Hallucination Removal:** Currently more robust for Japanese transcription than for English translation tasks.  
- **Goal:** Make it *fast* and *easy* for non-technical users.

## Getting Started

### 1. Extract MP3 (or WAV) Audio from Videos
You’ll need an MP3 (or WAV) file of your video. Popular tools:

- [Clever FFmpeg GUI](https://www.videohelp.com/software/clever-FFmpeg-GUI)  
- [VLC Media Player](https://youtu.be/sMy-T8RJAo0?si=AKg-WgDAAhtaBFkr)  
- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)  
- Direct `ffmpeg` command-line

> **Tip:** VLC and Audacity are user-friendly options if you prefer a graphical interface.

### 2. Create a “WhisperJAV” Folder in Google Drive
1. Go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/).  
2. Click **+ New** \> **Folder**, name it `WhisperJAV`.  
3. Drag and drop or upload your MP3/WAV files into this folder.

See these quick tutorials for more info:  
- [Organize your files in Google Drive](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375091?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop)  
- [Managing files on Google Drive (Video)](https://youtu.be/EKjnjySLTvM?si=SF8ww3z572FnO_cq)

### 3. Run WhisperJAV
Open our latest Colab notebook:

[**WhisperJAV v0.7b**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/meizhong986/WhisperJAV/blob/main/notebook/WhisperJAV_v0_7b.ipynb)

1. Once the notebook is open, go to **Runtime** \> **Run all**.  
2. When prompted, allow Google Colab to connect to your Google Drive (this gives it permission to read/write your WhisperJAV folder).  
3. If you change any options or get odd errors, select **Runtime** \> **Restart and run all** for a clean start.  
4. Watch out for Captcha-style checks—Google may ask if you’re still there.

### 4. Download Subtitles
- Final subtitles are saved to your `WhisperJAV` folder in Drive.  
- Colab will also automatically zip and download them when processing completes (depending on your settings).  
- Alternatively, you can manually download from Drive.
