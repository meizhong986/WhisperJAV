# 3.	Run WhisperJAV: 
Open the Whisper template: (latest is version 0.6)
 https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LTis2JcC66flJawHApGh29ZvKj4MuZl6#scrollTo=7zITdDF9fWEV

Run the template by clicking on top menu Runtime | Run all.  
The template is a notebook in Google Colab. In Google Colab, the menu items are located at the top of the page: File: , Edit: , View: , Insert: , Runtime, Tools. 
You want Runtime. This is the menu where you can run the template. For WhipserJAV you don’t need any other menu item than 3 items under Runtime:


To run all cells in your notebook, you can go to Runtime > Run all. 
If you’ve made changes to options, you want to start fresh: choose Runtime > Restart and run all. This will restart the runtime and then run all cells in order. 
After you’re done you want to Disconnect and delete. 

If you receive any error message that doesn’t make sense, usually those are caused by shared servers in Google. Just do a  Runtime > Restart and run all.  

Also pay attention that Google every now and then asks that you’re not a robot  😊
 

# 4.	Accept Permission Request from Google Colab to Connect with Google Drive: 
When connecting the template with Google Drive, you’ll be prompted to authorize access. 
Here’s a tutorial that explains the process.



# 5.	Download Subtitles from Google Drive: 
The subtitles are saved in WhisperJAV in your Google Drive by default. If you have changed the folder then look there. The subs are downloaded automatically as well as zipped and downloaded when runtime finishes. You can also download them one by one from your Drive.
