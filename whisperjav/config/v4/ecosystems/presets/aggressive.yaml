description_long: |
  The aggressive preset prioritizes recall over precision.

  Use this preset when:
  - Audio quality is poor
  - Speech is quiet or whispered
  - You need to capture everything, even at cost of artifacts
  - Multiple speakers or overlapping audio

  Characteristics:
  - Lower no-speech threshold
  - Higher temperature for diversity
  - Larger batch sizes for speed
  - Lower energy thresholds for scene detection

  Trade-offs:
  - May produce more hallucinations
  - May include non-speech sounds
  - May have more timing errors
