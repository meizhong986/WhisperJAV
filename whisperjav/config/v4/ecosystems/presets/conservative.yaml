  The conservative preset prioritizes precision over recall.

  Use this preset when:
  - Audio quality is good
  - You prefer fewer errors over completeness
  - Content has clear, distinct speech
  - You want to minimize hallucinations

  Characteristics:
  - Higher no-speech threshold
  - Lower temperature (deterministic)
  - Smaller batch sizes for stability
  - Higher energy thresholds for scene detection

recommended_for:
  - "Clean studio recordings"
  - "Clear single-speaker audio"
  - "Content where accuracy matters more than completeness"
